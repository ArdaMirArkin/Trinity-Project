🎓 Trinity Project — Technical Portfolio
Arda Mir Arkin — Early Decision Applicant (Trinity College, Fall 2026)
📘 Overview

This repository presents the technical projects I developed specifically for my Early Decision application to Trinity College.
My intention is to demonstrate initiative, creativity, and engineering ability as a prospective Bantam interested in Computer Science and Engineering.

I believe in showing, not telling.

🚀 Included Projects
1. Trinity Guide Mobile App (Android)

Status: Ongoing
A student-focused mobile application designed to help prospective Trinity students understand core aspects of campus life, including:

Campus life

Academics

Financial aid

Housing

Important deadlines

Campus safety information

If admitted, I plan to add:

✔ Real-time interactive campus map

✔ Role-based login (Student / Faculty / Parent)

✔ Alerts for deadlines, grades, appointments

✔ Parent notification system (with permission)

2. Trinity AI FAQ Chatbot

Status: Completed
A Python + SentenceTransformer-powered chatbot that answers common questions about Trinity College.
Hosted publicly using HuggingFace Spaces.

🔗 Live Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/MirArkin/Trinity-Chatbot

Purpose

Reduce repetitive workload for admissions staff

Provide instant responses to frequently asked questions

Offer a reliable resource for international and domestic applicants

3. AR Campus Visualization (Future Goal if Admitted)

A passion-driven augmented-reality project I hope to develop if I become a Bantam.

The AR visualizer will allow Trinity students to:

Explore campus buildings in 3D

View academic departments

Walk through campus virtually

See deadlines + events through AR markers

This would combine software engineering, 3D modeling, and campus engagement into an immersive Trinity-focused experience.
